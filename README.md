# Age_API
A simple django project which outputs API.

A django project which intakes day, month and year as three integer values and returns the age of the person. This also provides API of the said data.

Framworks used - Django , Rest Framework. HTML and Bootstrap also used.

This project basically works on the MVT - Model View Template framework of Django. Models regarding date , month , year and age are made to store the data. Views are used to get and post data to those said models. Templates are the web pages - the front end which the user sees to interact with.

The input of dynamic data was made possible by Forms - Django. These forms are further helpful in putting validations in the input so that there are no wrong responses.

It is a simple project with a specific button in the web page itself to get the API of the user data.
